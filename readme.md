## Motivation
------------------------------------------------------
* Whether trying to advance in your career or make a career switch, SQL appears to be a valuable skill to worth gaining. With many free and or inexpensive resources to learn writing SQL queries, learning this skill can help pave the way to success. 

## Job Interview preparation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* When preparing for a job interview it will be good idea to not only know the many technical aspects of relational databases and the technical aspects of writing SQL queries, but I imagine it would also be a good idea to know how to successfully write out SQL queries that will retrieve the desired results. The best way to get practice is to try and come up with different questions that could potentially come up during the technical part of the interview. Thinking of the many different types of questions related to how a company can be more successful are seemingly limitless.  
 

## Project format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This project will consist of creating a series of files containing 10 queries. The queries will range from beginner to intermediate level. It can be subjective as to what one considers beginner, intermediate, or advanced as people of different abilities and experience levels will have a different subjective opinion on the degree of difficulty in writing SQL queries. I will keep the difficulty of queries consistent for each file. If I designated a file as intermediate level, I would make all 10 queries around the same degree of difficulty unless otherwise noted in the notebook file. There may also be certain aspects that are more focused on as well. For instance, some notebook files may focus more on joins and subqueries while other notebooks will focus on aggregate functions, set operators, nested single-row functions, etc. Data manipulation language (DML) statements will not be the only types of SQL statements covered. There will also be notebook files on data definition language (DDL) statements, transaction control language (TCL) statements, and data control language (DCL) statements.
